# HTE (Hand Written Text Extraction)

TCS ION Remote Internships RIO-125
Project Name:- Automate extraction of handwritten text from an image

Project objective and brief:-
To develop machine learning algorithm in order to enable entity and knowledge extraction from documents with handwritten 
annotations, with an aim to identify handwritten words on an image

Project Guidelines:-
1) Prepare or collect some sample images containing handwritten text on them
(these images can be some scanned document copies as well).

2) The chosen image may include the following:-
	2.1) Cursive handwriting
	2.2) Poor image quality generated from frequently scanned documents
	2.3) Skewed Images
	
3) Develop a machine learning algorithm for detection and segmentation of handwritten text (word / sentences) from the
chosen images.

4) Test the application for reasonable accuracy.

Expected Project outcome:-
1) Algorithm to detect and segment handwritten text from an image
2) Detailed presentation with proof of reasonable accuracy
